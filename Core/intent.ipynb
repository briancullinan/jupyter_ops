You might need to add some () for grouping this like return values or sequenses, just like when writing a sentence (i.e. - means another way of saying).  In the intent language i.e. can be used to narrow down on function classifiers (i.e. using a data source) would import various data sources such as Google cloud storage, Amazon ECS resources, an sql database. The context of data source that is needed can be derived from the rest of the statement. For example (e.g. coming soon) `display json (i.e. using a data source)` would convert the output from a data source to a json display. This could be more specific such as `display json (i.e. using sqlite)` would only include the resources and sequences to accept an sqlite input and a json display.\n"
