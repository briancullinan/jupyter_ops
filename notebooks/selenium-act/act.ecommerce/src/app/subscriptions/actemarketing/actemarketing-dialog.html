    <h2>Payment, Term and Renewal</h2>
    Subscriptions automatically renew on the anniversary date of your initial purchase (monthly or annual). You are
    responsible for keeping your payment information current. Declined payments or other failure to make payment will
    result in cancellation of your service.

    <h2>Addition of Seats</h2>
    Additional users may be added at any time. When adding new users, you will be charged a pro-rated amount based on
    the remaining time in your term (monthly or annual). Your anniversary date for all users will remain the date of
    your original purchase.

    <h2>Cancellation</h2>
    To prevent automatic renewal, your subscription must be canceled before your renewal date. To cancel your
    subscription, please contactÂ Customer Support. No refunds will be processed for partial months (monthly
    subscription) or remaining months (annual subscription) of service. Upon cancellation, access to the application is
    removed, unless perpetual license rights were purchased upfront. In the event of removal of access to Act! Premium
    Cloud, your data is retained and is available for 90 days.
