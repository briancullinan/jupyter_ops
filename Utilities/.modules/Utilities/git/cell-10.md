TODO:

Rebase squash cherrypick automatically to create perfect feature branch?

Reset each file one at a time to make sure there aren't any unnecessary changes?

Use unit testing to warn about unnecessary modules?

Load relevant projects based on branch.  It could parse the .sln file and automatically patch whenever the checked out index changes.

Plot when a TODO: item is added and when it is removed on Google Calendar, then verify by checking commit -messages, remaining comments/function names with matching keywords (split by camel casing)?, plot dates completed for measurement of self set tasks and short term goals, which activities are harder than others?  better insight in to erroneous developer time estimates?

Interface for searching all TODO: items?  Calendar?
