TODO:

import module as notebook cell?

import gist as notebook

import random instructions as notebook

rules:
- testing cells have zero markdown before them,
- all public functions are made public using module.export or global namespace
- use describe( test blocks to describe parsing and replacement information for the functions it is testing, i.e. function utility(root) would have a describe block describe('utility(root)') neatly formated and parsed for calendar commands
- every file is one feature
- every cell or export should be a single purpose component with proper includes/dependencies
