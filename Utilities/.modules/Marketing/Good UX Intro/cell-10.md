## An existing customer enters the site

Currently, the landing site does not recognize existing customers.

Designs have been made to suggest the user could enter their e-mail address early on in the process.

With an Angular2 site, authentication is stored solely on the client (state-less), which means any part of the site could recognize the existing user and react to it by displaying up-sell items/ upgrades/ special offers to long term customers.
