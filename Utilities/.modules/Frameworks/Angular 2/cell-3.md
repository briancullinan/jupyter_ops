## Resilience

Resilience is how long in to the future will the software base be supported or continue working properly with little maintainence.

Resilience is a problem that plagues all software.  A Windows upgrade could happen in the background and introduce some breaking change that makes the app unusable.

Angular 2 has made this a very important priority by building a passionate community with a solid foundation of automated testing for it's underlying core components.

Microsoft and Google are both heavy investors in Angular 2 and Material Design.
