## Material Design

Material Design was created by Google.  It is a basic set of UI priciples that they have developed and tested to be easy to use across all platforms.

E.g.: 
* The focus of the content should be presented near the top of the page.  
* Any action items from the content should be highlighted so the user can see it easily.  
* Navigation should be consistent across all pages.  
* Content should look attractive and be fun to interact with.
