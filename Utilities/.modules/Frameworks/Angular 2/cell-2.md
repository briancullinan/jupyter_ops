## Architecture

How has Angular changed the architecture of software design?

"Serverless UX".  Angular forces the architect to separate the visual "client" experience from the server "back-end".

This allows the two piece, client and backend, to be designed and implemented simultaneously.

This means the projects can be kept separate but still be organized well and allow the developers to work on smaller pieces at a time.
