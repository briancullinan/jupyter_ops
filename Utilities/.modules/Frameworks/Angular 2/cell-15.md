## RxJs

Developed by Microsoft using principles from MVVM.

RxJs is used to respond to events.  Whenever something is clicked on and part of the page changes to acknowledge the click, RxJs is being used to respond to clicks in an organized way.

RxJs allows many things on the page to change based on clicks without making the page freeze from too much processing.
