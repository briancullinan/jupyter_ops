# Architecture

Angular 2 has a few key components that make the architecture an excellent choice for building web applications.

1. CLI - Compile your app just like MSBuild
2. Core - All the main functionality you need
3. RxJs - Highly reactive pages that respond to every interaction
3. Material - Components for good design
4. Router - Navigate to different pages without reloading the entire page
5. LESS / SASS - Design easily with variables and functions
6. Webpack / Lint - Minimize load times and help coders conform to good coding styles
